# My Java Unit Converter
## Overview
This is a hobby project that I started last year when I tried Java for the first time. I was actually awesome because of the way the language is structured. I was able to learn how to use Java after learning OOP in JavaScript and using the concept to create a music player [click here](https://github.com/chivicks-hazard/music-player). 

Well, I am a tech enthusiast and I like playing around with different technologies. So let's have with it.
